imageEditor
This program is an image editor that gets an image from a specified URL and allows the user to modify it. 
The program has three different parts: one is a pixel idenfier and allows users to "draw" on the image, the other one allows users to adjust brightness, saturation, and pixelation, and the third part turns the picture into a puzzle for the user to play.
